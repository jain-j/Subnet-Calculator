# Subnet-Calculator

Hello Everyone,
  Actually, I was learning about ip addressing (classfull addressing to be specific) 
in which the numbers change according to their bits. So, during learning it was very tedious
to calculate the subnet mask, corresponding class, host per network etc., again & again.
So, I understood their simple relation and mapping of their address class and subnets, & built this.....

  You have to just download subnet_calculator and run it - it does not require installation or anything.
  After run, you'll see output like final_output.jpg. You have to enter ip address and cidr value and click calculate and just see magic...
